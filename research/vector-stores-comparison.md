let vectorDB = VectorDatabase()
let results = try await vectorDB.search(vector: embedding, limit: 10)
```

### REST API Integration
```swift
struct VectorSearchClient {
    private let session = URLSession.shared
    
    func search(vector: [Float], topK: Int = 10) async throws -> SearchResults {
        let url = URL(string: "https://api.vectordb.com/search")!
        var request = URLRequest(url: url)
        request.httpMethod = "POST"
        request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
        
        let query = SearchQuery(vector: vector, topK: topK)
        request.httpBody = try JSONEncoder().encode(query)
        
        let (data, _) = try await session.data(for: request)
        return try JSONDecoder().decode(SearchResults.self, from: data)
    }
}
```

### Hybrid Architecture
```swift
// Combine local and cloud storage
actor VectorSearchManager {
    private let localDB: ObjectBox
    private let cloudClient: VectorSearchClient
    
    func search(query: String) async throws -> [SearchResult] {
        // Try local first
        let localResults = try await localDB.search(query: query)
        
        // Fallback to cloud if needed
        if localResults.isEmpty {
            return try await cloudClient.search(query: query)
        }
        
        return localResults
    }
}
```
