## Priority 1: Personal Knowledge Management Platforms (Highest ROI)

### 1. Notion AI
**Why Target**: 20M+ users, $10B valuation, strong integration ecosystem
**Key Contact**: Business Development team, Partnership inquiries
**Market Fit**: Perfect for "Work Context AI" positioning

**Outreach Template**:
```
Subject: Slack Intelligence Integration for Notion AI

Hi [Name],

Notion's AI workspace is impressive, especially the Claude integration and 70+ tool connections. I've built something that could add significant value: deep Slack intelligence.

Slunk provides:
- Real-time Slack message capture with local storage (privacy-first)
- 8 specialized search tools beyond basic text search  
- Thread context extraction and conversation analysis
- MCP protocol integration (like your Claude partnership)

This could enhance Notion AI by:
- Answering "What did the team decide about X?" from Slack discussions
- Auto-importing work conversations into personal knowledge bases
- Providing context for decisions made in Slack channels
- Creating meeting agendas from Slack conversations

Your users could build their "work brain" by combining Notion's structure with Slack's conversational intelligence.

### 2. Obsidian Community
**Why Target**: Open plugin ecosystem, AI-focused community, local-first philosophy  
**Key Contact**: Plugin marketplace, community developers
**Market Fit**: Aligns with privacy-first, extensible approach

**Outreach Template**:
```
Subject: Slack Intelligence Plugin for Obsidian Community

Hi [Name],

The Obsidian AI plugin ecosystem is thriving - I'm particularly impressed by Smart Second Brain and Khoj integrations. I've built something that could be valuable to the community.

Slunk is a Slack intelligence tool that:
- Captures and analyzes Slack conversations locally (no cloud)
- Provides 8 specialized search tools for workplace context
- Uses MCP protocol for seamless AI integration
- Maintains full data ownership (markdown compatible)

Potential Obsidian integrations:
- Auto-import work conversations as linked notes
- Create connection graphs between Slack discussions and personal notes
- Enable AI queries across both personal knowledge and work conversations
- Link code discussions from Slack to development notes

Would the community be interested in a Slack intelligence plugin?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### 3. Mem AI
**Why Target**: AI-first approach, entrepreneur/executive focus, Series A funded
**Key Contact**: Business development team
**Market Fit**: Self-organizing intelligence aligns with Slunk's AI capabilities

**Outreach Template**:
```
Subject: Workplace Intelligence Layer for Mem AI

Hi [Name],

Mem's AI-powered note organization is brilliant - eliminating folders through intelligent connections. Slunk could add a crucial missing piece: workplace conversation intelligence.

Current gap: Mem organizes personal notes beautifully, but work decisions often happen in Slack conversations that never make it into knowledge management systems.

Slunk's contribution:
- Real-time Slack conversation capture and analysis
- Automatic extraction of decisions, action items, and context
- Thread relationship mapping across channels and time
- Pattern discovery in team communications

Integration possibilities:
- Auto-surface relevant Slack context when working on projects
- Connect personal notes to related work discussions
- Suggest Mem notes based on current Slack conversations
- Create comprehensive project timelines combining notes + Slack

This could make Mem the complete "second brain" for knowledge workers.

Interested in discussing?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### 4. Reflect Notes
**Why Target**: $10/month price point, Readwise partnership, AI integration focus
**Key Contact**: Partnership team
**Market Fit**: Strategic integration approach, OpenAI partnership precedent

**Outreach Template**:
```
Subject: Slack Context Integration for Reflect Notes

Hi [Name],

Reflect's approach to strategic integrations (like Readwise) rather than building everything in-house is smart. I've built a Slack intelligence tool that could be your next strategic partnership.

Similar to how Readwise brings reading highlights into Reflect, Slunk could bring workplace conversation intelligence:

- Import relevant Slack discussions as context-rich notes
- Link work conversations to personal reflection notes  
- Provide AI-powered insights from team communications
- Enable "chat with your work conversations" functionality

Key advantages:
- Local processing (privacy-first like Reflect)
- MCP protocol compatibility (easy integration)
- Specialized for workplace intelligence (not competing with core features)
- $10-20/month price point alignment for consumer market

Would you be interested in exploring this as a strategic integration?

Best,
[Your Name]

## Priority 2: Consumer Productivity Platforms

### 1. Personal AI Assistant Startups
**Targets**: Y Combinator AI assistant startups, consumer-focused platforms
**Approach**: Position as "workplace data connector"

**Template**:
```
Subject: Workplace Intelligence Connector for [Platform]

Hi [Name],

Personal AI assistants need rich data sources to be truly useful. While most focus on personal data (calendar, email, documents), there's a huge gap: workplace conversations.

Slunk fills this gap by providing:
- Real-time Slack intelligence with local processing
- 8 specialized search tools for workplace context
- MCP protocol integration for AI platforms
- Privacy-first approach (data never leaves user's device)

This could enable your assistant to answer:
- "What blockers did my team mention this week?"
- "Find the decision about the API architecture"
- "Summarize feedback on the product launch"
- "What's the team sentiment around the new feature?"

Interested in adding workplace intelligence to your platform?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### 2. Apple Shortcuts/Automation Enthusiasts
**Approach**: Build community integrations, share workflows
**Platform**: Reddit r/shortcuts, automation communities

**Community Post Template**:
```
