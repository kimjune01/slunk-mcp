# Checkpoint - Quick Project Health Check

Perform essential maintenance between milestones. Focus on what matters most.

## Core Tasks (15-20 minutes max)

1. **Build & Test**
   - Build the project and fix any errors
   - Run tests and address failures
   - Note: Skip if you're confident everything works

2. **Fix Obvious Issues**
   - Search for TODO/FIXME comments and fix the quick ones (< 5 min each)
   - Remove unused imports and dead code you notice
   - Fix any obvious typos or outdated comments

3. **Documentation Reality Check**
   - Does README.md match what the app actually does?
   - Is CLAUDE.md tool count correct? (should be 8 tools)
   - Fix any glaring inaccuracies you notice

4. **Commit Changes**
   - Create a commit with your improvements
   - Use format: `chore: checkpoint - [brief summary of main fixes]`

## When to Skip

- If you just did a checkpoint recently
- If major refactoring is planned soon
- If you're in the middle of a complex feature

## When to Go Deeper

Only investigate further if you find:
- Security issues
- Performance problems
- Broken functionality
- Seriously outdated documentation
