# Quick Fixes - Fast Code Quality Improvements

Perform quick, low-risk code quality improvements that can be done in under 15 minutes.

## Instructions

1. **Import Cleanup**
   - Remove unused import statements
   - Organize imports alphabetically
   - Group system imports vs. project imports
   - Remove duplicate imports

2. **Code Formatting**
   - Fix inconsistent indentation
   - Ensure consistent spacing around operators
   - Align similar code structures
   - Remove trailing whitespace

3. **Simple Refactoring**
   - Extract magic numbers into named constants
   - Rename variables with unclear names (a, temp, data)
   - Break up overly long lines (>120 characters)
   - Remove commented-out code that's no longer needed

4. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Replace force unwrapping with safe alternatives where obvious
   - Add missing error handling for simple cases
   - Use guard statements for early returns
   - Add descriptive error messages

5. **Documentation Quick Wins**
   - Add missing parameter documentation for public functions
   - Fix obvious typos in comments
   - Add brief descriptions to complex functions
   - Update outdated comments

6. **Performance Quick Wins**
   - Use `let` instead of `var` where values don't change
   - Replace string concatenation with string interpolation
   - Use more efficient collection methods where obvious
   - Remove unnecessary object allocations in loops

7. **SwiftUI Specific**
   - Remove unnecessary `@State` wrappers
   - Use `@StateObject` vs `@ObservedObject` correctly
   - Extract complex views into smaller components
   - Use proper SwiftUI lifecycle methods

8. **Testing Quick Fixes**
   - Remove or update obsolete test comments
   - Add missing test descriptions
   - Fix obviously broken test assertions
   - Remove duplicate test cases

## Quality Checks

1. **Before Making Changes**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Note current build warnings count
   - Check git status for uncommitted changes

2. **After Each Fix**
   - Verify code still compiles
   - Run affected tests
   - Check that behavior hasn't changed

3. **Final Validation**
   - Build entire project
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify warning count decreased or stayed same

## Success Criteria

- Code compiles without new warnings
- All tests continue to pass
- Code is more readable and maintainable
- No behavioral changes introduced
- Consistent code style throughout
- Reduced technical debt

## Time Limit

- Maximum 15 minutes per quick-fixes session
- Stop if any change requires deeper investigation
- Create TODO for complex issues discovered
- Focus on high-impact, low-risk improvements

## When to Run

- Before starting major features
- During checkpoint process
- When waiting for builds/tests
- As warm-up coding activity
- Before code reviews
